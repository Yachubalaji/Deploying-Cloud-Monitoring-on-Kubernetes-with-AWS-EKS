# Deploying-Cloud-Monitoring-on-Kubernetes-with-AWS-EKS
This repository contains a Python application designed for deployment on Kubernetes, leveraging Docker for containerization and AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) for orchestration. It demonstrates a cloud-native approach to developing and deploying scalable applications.

Overview
The project showcases a Python application setup, including Docker containerization and Kubernetes deployment, specifically tailored for AWS EKS. It provides a foundation for deploying scalable and resilient applications on the cloud.

Files Description
app.py: The main Python application file, implementing the core functionality of the project. It serves as the entry point for the application logic.

eks.py: A Python script for managing AWS EKS resources, facilitating the automation of Kubernetes cluster operations within the AWS ecosystem.

Dockerfile: Contains the specifications for building the Docker image of the Python application, defining the runtime environment, dependencies, and instructions for running the application.

deployment.yaml: Kubernetes deployment configuration file that specifies how the application should be deployed in a Kubernetes environment, including replicas, resource requests, and other deployment settings.

service.yaml: Defines the Kubernetes service that exposes the deployed application, detailing how the application communicates with the outside world or other services within the cluster.

requirements.txt: Lists the Python dependencies required by the application, ensuring consistent execution environments across different setups.
